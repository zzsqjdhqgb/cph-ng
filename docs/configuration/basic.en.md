# Basic Settings

General settings that control UI behavior and folder selection methods.

## Folder Selection

### `cph-ng.basic.folderOpener`

Controls which method is used for selecting folders in dialogs.

- **Type**: String enum (`"default"` | `"native"`)
- **Default**: `"default"`
- **User Impact**:
    - `"default"`: Uses VS Code's standard folder picker (works in all
      environments including remote development)
    - `"native"`: Uses system native folder dialog (may provide better UX on
      local systems but doesn't work in remote/web environments)

**Example**:

```json
{
    "cph-ng.basic.folderOpener": "native"
}
```

_When loading test cases from a folder, the system's native folder picker will
be used instead of VS Code's dialog._

## When to Change This Setting

- **Use "default"**: If you work with remote development (SSH, WSL, containers),
  or experience issues with folder selection
- **Use "native"**: If you prefer your operating system's folder picker and work
  only on local files
